# Webhooks

Instead of having you poll for status of commands, each command will deliver a webhook even once it is done (successfully or failed). The same details will be sent as the polling request - command\_id, output files, failure reason (if applicable), running time.

You could use these webhook especially for ease of integration to no-code or low-code solutions where polling is less comfortable - such as Zapier, Make etc.

# Chained commands

Sometimes we run FFmpeg to create another video, and from that output video we want to create a gif or a thumbnail.&#x20;

We will allow you to specify a new type of command - `Chained Command` - where you could stack FFmpeg commands to do just that

# Zapier and Make integrations

Currently you can integrate Rendi with Zapier and Make through RESTful requests.

We are working on native Zapier and Make integrations that will allow you to send commands and receive notifications via webhooks without handling the RESTful integration.
