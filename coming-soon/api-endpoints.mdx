# Webhooks

Instead of having you poll for status of commands, each command will deliver a webhook even once it is done (successfully or failed). The same details will be sent as the polling request - command\_id, output files, failure reason (if applicable), running time.

You could use these webhook especially for ease of integration to no-code or low-code solutions where polling is less comfortable - such as zapier, make etc.

# Chained commands

Sometimes we run ffmpeg to create another video, and from that output video we want to create a gif or a thumbnail.&#x20;

We will allow you to specify a new type of command - `Chained Command` - where you could stack ffmpeg commands to do just that
