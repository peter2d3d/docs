description: "FFmpeg as a Service"
---

Built by developers with vast experience building media apps, we spent heavily on running and maintaining FFmpeg swarms, and now we do it so that you don't have to.

Using Rendi is indeed as simple as just using FFmpeg locally, but without needing to install anything, just by using RESTful HTTP requests.

# RESTful API

Send your FFmpeg command to our API for processing, and then recieve the resulting files stored on our cloud storage.

We provide the service through a RESTful API in order to keep it as simple as possible, without having you incur any costs of implementation.

We want to allow you to easily integrate whatever environment you want - python, NodeJS, Zapier, make, n8n, anything, since everything works with web requests.

<Note>All examples are using `curl` command line tool - for straightforward http requests. You can use whatever environment (Python, NodeJS, n8n, etc.) you want to run the same requests.</Note>

# Why use Rendi?

* No lock-in with custom interfaces - it's pure FFmpeg with all its' richness

* No need to integrate anything special - just use HTTP REST

* Basically - No learning curve (well, after you've mastered FFmpeg's syntax ;) )

* Our powerful servers are always up, with load balancing, without boot time

* We optimize our servers to run FFmpeg as efficiently as possible

* We maintain and update our FFmpeg environments seamlessly, providing you with the most up to date installations
