Built by developers with vast experience building media apps, we spent heavily on running and maintaining FFmpeg swarms, and now we do it so that you don't have to.

### What makes us focused on builders?

* No lock-in with custom interfaces - it's pure FFmpeg with all its' richness

* No need to integrate anything special - just use HTTP REST

* Basically - No learning curve (well, after you've mastered FFmpeg's syntax ;) )

* Our powerful servers are always up, with load balancing, without boot time

* We optimize our servers to run FFmpeg as efficiently as possible, using custom built binaries and GPUs when possible

* We maintain and update our FFmpeg environments seamlessly, providing you with the most up to date installations
