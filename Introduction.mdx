description: "FFmpeg as a Service for Builders"
---

Built by developers with vast experience building media apps, we spent heavily on running and maintaining FFmpeg swarms, and now we do it so that you don't have to.

# RESTful API

We currently only provide the service through a simple RESTful HTTP API, this is in order to keep it as simple as possible, without having you incur any costs of implementation.

We want to allow you to easily integrate whatever system you want - python, NodeJS, Zapier, make, n8n, anything, since everything works with web requests.

# What makes us focused on builders?

* No lock-in with custom interfaces - it's pure FFmpeg with all its' richness

* No need to integrate anything special - just use HTTP REST

* Basically - No learning curve (well, after you've mastered FFmpeg's syntax ;) )

* Our powerful servers are always up, with load balancing, without boot time

* We optimize our servers to run FFmpeg as efficiently as possible, using custom built binaries and GPUs when possible

* We maintain and update our FFmpeg environments seamlessly, providing you with the most up to date installations
